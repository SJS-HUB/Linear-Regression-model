# 🚀 Startup Profit Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict profits of startups based on features like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and Location. The dataset used contains information about 50 startups and their corresponding expenditures and profits.

## 📌 Objective

Build a predictive model that accurately estimates a startup's profit, helping businesses understand which factors drive growth and ROI. The project also focuses on visualizing relationships and validating model assumptions.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **R&D Spend** showed the strongest positive correlation with Profit (correlation coefficient ≈ 0.97).
- **Linear Regression** achieved an **R² Score of 0.8987**, indicating that ~90% of the variation in profits is explained by the model.
- Residuals were randomly scattered around zero → assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity are reasonably met.
